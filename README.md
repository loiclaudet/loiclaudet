## hi there 👋

i'm Loïc, a design engineer based in cyprus 🇨🇾

i love crafting beautiful and creative products, and exploring the possibilities of the web with frontend technologies.

outside of code, you’ll find me playing sports ⚽️🏋️🏓, reading books, and enjoying card games.

i also enjoy writing blog posts and sharing tech-related content on social media.
